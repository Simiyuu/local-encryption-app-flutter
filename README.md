Local Encryption & Decryption App in Flutter – A Beginner’s Guide

Objective

This project uses Flutter, a UI toolkit for building apps that work on different platforms with the Dart programming language. Flutter was chosen because it enables one codebase to operate on multiple platforms, including Windows, Android, Web, and iOS.

The goal is to create a **local encryption and decryption application that lets the user:
- Enter plain text
- Encrypt the message on the device
- Decrypt the encrypted message back to its original form

By the end of this project, a beginner should be able to:
- Set up Flutter on their computer
- Understand basic encryption concepts
- Run a secure local Flutter application that can encrypt and decrypt messages

Google's open-source framework Flutter is a top choice, when building cross-platform applications. Using the Dart language, Flutter lets developers create fast, natively compiled, and visually stunning mobile, desktop and web applications from a single codebase, and its applications can run on Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, macOS, web applications and even embedded systems UI. 

Coming from real world examples, Google Pay, Alibaba, BMW App, and eBay Motors are all popular applications that have been built with Flutter.


System Requirements

MacOS or Linux, when developing and running the Local Encryption & Decryption App in Flutter you'll need Windows 10 or newer. 

This project was specifically implemented and tested on Windows, and for it to run smoothly you'll need the Flutter SDK, Git, Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, Google Chrome/Microsoft Edge, Dart, the encrypt package and the default Flutter package. 

Coming hotfooting into this project without these won't be very pleasant. 

Dart is the language used in the app, and the encrypt and flutter packages are the ones used for encryption and decryption. 

You'll also need at least 8 GB of RAM, 10 GB of free disk space and a stable internet connection to set up and install the packages.
